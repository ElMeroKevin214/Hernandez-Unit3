<p><b>As you can see in the pictures on top, the team looks like a unity not just because of the team hugging but if only you would be able to see them play together you would know that the team doesn't just depend on only 1 player but they depend on the whole team. They mostly have their two best midfielders to score and to pick the team back up when the team is down or lossing. Right now this team is known as the fourth best national team in the world which got to the finals in the 2010 and unfortunately they lost against Spain.</b> </p>
